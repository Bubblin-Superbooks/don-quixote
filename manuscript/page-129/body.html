B. "But what becomes of all the hay and corn?" R. "My master gives me none; he's much too mean." B. "Come, come, you show ill-breeding, sir, I ween; 'T is like an ass your master thus to scorn." R. He is an ass, will die an ass, an ass was born; Why, he's in love; what's what's plainer to be seen?" B. "To be in love is folly?"--R. "No great sense." B. "You're metaphysical."--R. "From want of food." B. "Rail at the squire, then."--R. "Why, what's the good? I might indeed complain of him, I grant ye, But, squire or master, where's the difference? They're both as sorry hacks as Rocinante."</p></div> </div>
